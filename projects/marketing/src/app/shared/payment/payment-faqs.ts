    question: "What is an event?",
    answer:
      "Events are the unit of measure for tracking GlitchTip usage. An organization's maximum number of events per month is determined by its subscription type.

    question: "What happens when I exceed my event limit?",

  },

  {
    question: "Is GlitchTip really free to self-host?",
    answer:
      "Yes. GlitchTip is free to self-host with unlimited events, projects, and team members. No paid plan is required. If your business uses GlitchTip in production, we expect you to purchase a license to support continued development.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a Commercial License to use GlitchTip at work?",
    answer:
      "If your business uses GlitchTip at work, purchasing a Commercial License is expected. There are no premium features — what you're paying for is support.",

  {
    question: "Can I get HIPAA compliance with self-hosted?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Since you control the infrastructure, you are responsible for your own security controls, BAAs with sub-processors, and compliance obligations. GlitchTip's open-source codebase is fully auditable.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is self-hosted pricing different from hosted?",
    answer:
      "Self-hosted pricing is per-user rather than per-event. The Starter Edition is free. Commercial and Scaled Support plans are billed per user per month, with annual billing discounts available. Scaled Support requires a 10-user minimum for contract-based arrangements.",

  {
    question:
      "What's the difference between Starter Edition and Commercial License?",
    answer:
      "The Starter Edition is free and includes everything GlitchTip offers. If you're running it in production, we expect you to hold a Commercial License — that's what gets you update assistance and priority support from us.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I migrate from hosted to self-hosted (or vice versa)?",
