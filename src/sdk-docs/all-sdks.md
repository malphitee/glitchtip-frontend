To start using GlitchTip, you need to:

1. Install the sentry SDK for your platform into your project.
2. Configure it with your **DSN** (Data Source Name) so it knows where to send events. Your DSN is shown below, and can also be found in your project's settings.
3. Initialize the SDK early in your application's startup.

## General Configuration

Most SDKs support these options:

- **dsn** — Where to send event data. Found in GlitchTip under project settings.
- **release** — Your application version (e.g., `"1.0.0"`). Helps track which releases introduce errors.
- **environment** — The running environment name (e.g., `"production"`, `"staging"`).
- **traces_sample_rate** — Sample rate for performance transactions (`0.0` to `1.0`). Use a low value like `0.01` (1%) in production to save disk space.
- **auto_session_tracking** — Set to `false`. GlitchTip does not support session tracking.

## Performance Monitoring

Enable [performance monitoring](/documentation/performance) by setting `traces_sample_rate`. Sample your transactions to keep data volume manageable — most teams find 1–10% sufficient.

## Logs

GlitchTip can ingest [application logs](/documentation/logs) via OpenTelemetry. See the logs documentation for setup.

## Source Maps & Debug Symbols

Use the [GlitchTip CLI](/documentation/cli) to upload source maps and debug symbols for readable stack traces in production.

## AI-Assisted Debugging

GlitchTip includes an [MCP server](/documentation/mcp) that lets AI assistants investigate errors, analyze performance, and query logs.
